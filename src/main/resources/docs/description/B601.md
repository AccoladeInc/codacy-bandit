## Sanitize Paramiko's inputs 

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. 
It is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell injection attacks. 
The inputs for Paramiko’s “exec_command” or “invoke_shell” methods should be correctly sanitized.
