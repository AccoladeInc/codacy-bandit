## Avoid using weak cryptographic keys

As computational power increases, so does the ability to break ciphers with smaller key lengths. 
The recommended key length size for RSA and DSA algorithms is 2048 and higher. 
1024 bits and below are now considered breakable. 
EC key length sizes are recommended to be 224 and higher with 160 and below considered breakable.
