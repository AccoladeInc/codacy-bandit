## Avoid spawning a subprocess without a shell

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. 
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.
The spawning of a subprocess without the use of a command shell is not vulnerable to shell injection attacks, 
but care should still be taken to ensure validity of input.
