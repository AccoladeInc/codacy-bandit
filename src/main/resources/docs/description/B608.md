## Avoid hardcoded sql expressions

An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data given to an application. It is a very common attack vector. 
Unless care is taken to sanitize and control the input data when building such SQL statement strings, an injection attack becomes possible.
