## Avoid calling functions with shell=True

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. 
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.
This plugin test interrogates method calls for the presence of a keyword parameter shell equalling true. 
It is related to detection of shell injection issues and is intended to catch custom wrappers to vulnerable methods that may have been created.
