## Hardcoded temporary directory

### Problematic code:

```python
import os
import tempfile

# This will most certainly put you at risk
tmp = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), filename)
if not os.path.exists(tmp):
    with open(tmp, "w") file:
        file.write("defaults")
```

### Correct code:

```python
import os
import tempfile

# Use the TemporaryFile context manager for easy clean-up
with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as tmp:
    # Do stuff with tmp
    tmp.write('stuff')

# Clean up a NamedTemporaryFile on your own
# delete=True means the file will be deleted on close
tmp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True)
try:
    # do stuff with temp
    tmp.write('stuff')
finally:
    tmp.close()  # deletes the file

# Handle opening the file yourself. This makes clean-up
# more complex as you must watch out for exceptions
fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp()
try:
    with os.fdopen(fd, 'w') as tmp:
        # do stuff with temp file
        tmp.write('stuff')
finally:
    os.remove(path)
```

### Rationale:

Often we want to create temporary files to save data that we canâ€™t hold in memory or to pass to external programs that must read from a file. 
The obvious way to do this is to generate a unique file name in a common system temporary directory such as /tmp, but doing so correctly is harder than it seems. 
We should never do this ourselves but use the correct existing library function. 
We also must take care to cleanup our temporary files even in the face of errors.
